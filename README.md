# NewsPage

To run this news site app, you need to follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine by running git clone git@github.com:Marko1310/NewsPage.git in your terminal.
2. Install the required dependencies by running npm install.
3. Start the development server by running npm start.
4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.


Build and Design Decisions:

1. I decided to use React as the framework for building the app because of its flexibility, ease of use, and large community support.
2. I decided to build the app with Vite because of its simple configuration, fast build time,
   and the ability to make changes to my code and see them reflected immediately in the browser, without the need to refresh the page.
3. I designed the app with a simple, intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate. The layout is clean and uncluttered to allow users to focus on the news content.
4. I used a responsive design approach to ensure that the app works well on different screen sizes and devices.
5. I added a favorite icon to the bottom edge of every article to indicate to the user that they can save it.
   When the user clicks the icon, its fill color changes to visually confirm that the article is saved.
   The saved articles are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain accessible even after the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.
   The saved articles will only be removed if the user decides to remove them.

Overall, my goal was to create a news site app that is simple, user-friendly, and efficient in delivering the latest news to users.
